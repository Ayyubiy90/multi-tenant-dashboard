Frontend Developer Technical Assessment
Project: Multi-tenant Dashboard Analytics Platform
Background
You are tasked with building a crucial component of our SaaS platform: a real-time analytics dashboard that serves multiple customer organizations (tenants) with different user roles and permission levels.
Core Features
1. Multi-tenant Dashboard
   * Create a dashboard that displays analytics data for different organizations
   * Implement tenant isolation to ensure data security
   * Handle tenant-specific themes and customizations
2. User Management
   * Support multiple user roles:
      * Admin (full access to organization settings and all data)
      * Manager (access to specific department data and team management)
      * Viewer (read-only access to assigned dashboards)
   * Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
3. Analytics Display
   * Create widgets for displaying:
      * Daily active users
      * Revenue metrics
      * User engagement statistics
   * Implement real-time updates
   * Allow widget customization based on user permissions
Technical Requirements
1. Architecture
   * Use Next.js 14+ with App Router
   * Implement proper route organization for multi-tenant support
   * Design a scalable state management solution
2. Performance Optimization
   * Implement efficient data fetching strategies
   * Use proper caching mechanisms
   * Optimize for large datasets
   * Handle concurrent user sessions
3. Code Organization
   * Follow component-driven development
   * Implement proper type safety with TypeScript
   * Create reusable hooks and utilities
Assessment Tasks
Task 1: Multi-tenant Route Structure
Create a route structure that supports:
/[tenant]/dashboard
/[tenant]/settings
/[tenant]/users
Demonstrate how you would:
* Handle tenant-specific middleware
* Implement tenant isolation
* Manage tenant-specific configurations
Task 2: Real-time Dashboard Widget
Create a reusable dashboard widget component that:
* Accepts different data types
* Implements real-time updates
* Handles loading and error states
* Considers performance optimization
* Implements proper access control based on user role
Task 3: Performance Optimization
Optimize the dashboard for performance by:
* Implementing efficient data fetching
* Using proper caching strategies
* Handling server-side vs client-side rendering decisions
* Implementing pagination or infinite scroll for large datasets
